Though Python is free and open-source, managing the packages could sometimes be difficult, especially if you have multiple python kernels installed. Therefore, it is suggested to use virtual environment to manage the package in this project. For doing this:

1. In VS Code, type "Ctrl + Shift + P"
2. In the window that appears, types "Python: Create Environment".
3. Choose venv.
4. Choose the kernel you would like to use.
5. Open the terminal. Type ".venv/Script/active".
6. In the terminal, type "pip install requirements.tex". This will install all the packages needed for this project.
